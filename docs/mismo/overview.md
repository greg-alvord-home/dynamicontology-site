# MISMO

**MISMO** (the Mortgage Industry Standards Maintenance Organization) publishes widely used mortgage data standards, including large, long-lived **XML Schemas (XSD)** that encode substantial domain structure.

In the OWB program, MISMO serves as a **flagship case study** because it is:
- **High complexity** (deep type hierarchies and extensive reuse)
- **Strongly governed** (standards-driven evolution)
- **Versioned over time** (semantic drift and compatibility questions)
- **Operationally important** (real industry adoption)

OWB uses MISMO examples to demonstrate how **latent semantics in schemas** can be made explicit as:
- RDF/OWL ontologies (conceptual structure)
- SHACL shapes (testable constraints)
- Visualizations (inspectable graphs)

> MISMO is a case study—not a limitation.  
> The OWB approach is designed to generalize to other schema-driven standards and domains.

TODO (internal):
- Link to first MISMO demo outputs (report + TTL + visualization)
- Add a short “why MISMO XSD patterns matter” section
- Add versioning approach and naming/IRI policy notes

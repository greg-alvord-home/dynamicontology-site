# Ontology Workbench (OWB)

The Ontology Workbench (OWB) is a desktop and programmatic environment
for inspecting, generating, and validating ontologies derived from
real-world schemas.

This section will cover:
- Design goals and non-goals
- Supported inputs and outputs
- Visualization and inspection capabilities
- Integration with RDF stores and SHACL engines

Content will be published as individual components stabilize.

# Dynamic Ontology

**Dynamic Ontology** is a research and tooling initiative focused on
making formal semantic structures *practical, inspectable, and evolvable*
for real-world schemas and data systems.

This site introduces the **Ontology Workbench (OWB)** and related tools
for exploring how schemas (XSD, JSON Schema, contractual models) encode
latent ontological meaning — and how that meaning can be made explicit,
computable, and verifiable.

## Current Status

This site is in **early public preview**.

Initial content establishes:
- Core concepts and motivation
- High-level architecture of OWB
- Representative demonstrations (using simplified schemas)

Additional documentation, examples, and datasets will be added incrementally.
